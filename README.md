Welcome to Webserv - a project designed to deepen your understanding of web server implementation through hands-on coding and experimentation. This README provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and instructions for usage and contribution.

Project Overview:

Webserv is an HTTP server implementation written in C++98, aimed at facilitating the understanding of the HTTP protocol and server-client interactions. By crafting your own HTTP server, you'll gain insights into the inner workings of web servers, request handling, and response generation.

Key Features:

HTTP Protocol Handling: Webserv delves into the intricacies of the HTTP protocol, encompassing request parsing, response generation, and status code handling.

Non-blocking I/O: The server is designed to handle I/O operations in a non-blocking manner, ensuring efficient resource utilization and responsiveness.

Configuration Flexibility: Webserv allows for customizable server configurations via a configuration file, enabling users to define server parameters such as ports, hostnames, and behavior.

Dynamic Content Support: The project provides support for serving dynamic content through CGI (Common Gateway Interface), facilitating interaction with scripts and applications.
